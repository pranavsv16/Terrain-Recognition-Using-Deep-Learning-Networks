# Terrain-Recognition-Using-Deep-Learning-Networks
Humans naturally develop walking capability that is energy efficient, stable, environment adaptive, and robust. Lower limb amputations, unfortunately, disrupt this ability; individuals with lower limb amputations usually depend on prosthetic devices to restore the basic walking function. Lower-limb robotic prosthetics can benefit from context awareness to provide enhanced comfort and safety to the amputee. In this work, we aim to develop a terrain identification system based on inertial measurement units IMU streams collected from the lower limb. The system for a prosthetic leg uses visual and inertial sensors though, but we are willing to observe if terrain identification without the visual data is viable. With such information, the control of a robotized prosthetic leg can be adapted to changes in its surrounding.

In this project, researched various deep learning models and developed a Bi-LSTM model to classify the terrain based on time series data.
